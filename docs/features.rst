========

This application offers several important features that are useful for network auditing and learning about host services:

- GUI built with PySide6 for interactive scanning
- TCP Connect scanning with banner grabbing
- TCP SYN scanning (Scapy required, faster, requires privileges)
- UDP scanning with protocol-specific probes
- Host discovery (ICMP or system ping fallback)
- Export results to TXT, CSV, and JSON
- Interactive filtering and contextual copy actions in results table

Use these features together responsibly to perform safe and legal network analysis.
